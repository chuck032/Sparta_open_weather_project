## Aims

For this project I was required to create an open weather service object model. This involved testing the OpenWeatherMap api, making sure I could parse the data and manipulate it in order to  complete tests. The next task was to generate a random id from a yaml file and test the data generated from this file. Finally I tested a list of cities JSON file, more specifically making sure the ID generated was the same as the ID in the JSON file. And eventually testing that the JSON file hashes matched the weather api.
